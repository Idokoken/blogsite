        <h2>Brief History of Slave Trade in West Africa</h2>

        <p>
          Slavery has historically been widespread in Africa. Systems of
          servitude and slavery were common in parts of Africa in ancient times,
          as they were in much of the rest of the ancient world.When the
          trans-Saharan slave trade, Indian Ocean slave trade and Atlantic slave
          trade (which started in the 16th century)began, many of the
          pre-existing local African slave systems began supplying captives for
          slave markets outside Africa.Slavery in contemporary Africa is still
          practised despite it being illegal. In the relevant literature African
          slavery is categorized into indigenous slavery and export slavery,
          depending on whether or not slaves were traded beyond the
          continent.Slavery in historical Africa was practised in many different
          forms: Debt slavery, enslavement of war captives, military slavery,
          slavery for prostitution, and enslavement of criminals were all
          practised in various parts of Africa. Slavery for domestic and court
          purposes was widespread throughout Africa. Plantation slavery also
          occurred, primarily on the eastern coast of Africa and in parts of
          West Africa. The importance of domestic plantation slavery increased
          during the 19th century, due to the abolition of the Atlantic slave
          trade. Many African states dependent on the international slave trade
          reoriented their economies towards legitimate commerce worked by slave
          labour.
