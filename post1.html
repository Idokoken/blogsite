        <h2>How to prepare Nigeria fried Rice</h2>
        <p>
          Nigerian Fried Rice is a very simple yet delicious recipe. This
          version relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little
          bit of oil for crisping it up. The added beef liver gives the fried
          Rice a very nice rich but subtle taste, and this is why it is one of
          the most popular choices in Nigeria. Though you can also use Shrimp or
          any protein you’d like. If you would love to make vegan fried rice,
          you can omit the Beef liver or Shrimps entirely! This fried rice is
          entirely different from the popular Asian Chicken Fried Rice because
          the depth of the taste in the later comes from the Soy sauce while the
          depth of taste of the later comes from the Curry powder, Thyme,
          Seasoning cubes, and of course the abundance of vegetables like
          Carrots, Green beans, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions.

            It’s o.k to add a dash of cayenne pepper if you like some heat!
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t over boil your Rice before frying it, otherwise, you will end
            up with a soggy fried rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t
            overcook your veggies.
          </li>
          <li>
            I used mixed veggies which consist of Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet
            Corn, and Green Beans. However, vegetables like sweet bell peppers
            can also be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to achieve that nice coveted crisp, you will need to turn
            up the heat to high during the frying process and stir continuously
            as you allow the rice to heat up.
          </li>
          <li>
            I added pieces of beef liver in my fried Rice, a lot of people like
            this as well, but if you don’t want it you are free to leave it out,
            you will still enjoy the total goodness of the Fried Rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            When making this Fried Rice, it is best to use Chicken stock or
            Turkey stock because of their mils taste. The beef stock should be
            avoided as it can overpower the taste of the fried rice
