        <h2>How to make local Yogurt</h2>
        <h3>Steps in making Homemade Yogurt</h3>
        <p>
          Making yogurt is part cooking, part science experiment. The first time
          will take a little longer as you learn the steps and remember to
          monitor the temperatures, but once you get the hang of it, yogurt
          making is easy and the result will be just as good as commercial
          yogurt. Here is a basic step-by-step guide for a simple yogurt recipe
        </p>
        <h3>Choose your milk</h3>
        <p>
          The first step in making yogurt is to choose the milk you want to use:
          skim milk, low fat, or whole milk. You can even use goat’s milk if you
          prefer its taste. The higher the milk fat, the creamier and richer the
          yogurt will be. You can also choose between raw milk or pasteurized. A
          half-gallon of milk will make a little more than that in yogurt.
        </p>
        <h3>Heat the milk</h3>
        <p>
          Your goal is to get the milk to reach 180 F so have a digital cooking
          or candy thermometer handy to monitor the temperature. Turn your stove
          to medium heat. Pour the milk into a pan, stirring to evenly heat the
          milk. Remove from the heat when the milk reaches 180 F.
        </p>
        <h3>Cool milk</h3>

        <p>
          Pour the milk into glass jars, like a mason jar with a lid. Let the
          milk cool to 115 F. You can either let it sit at room temperature or
          you can speed up the cooling process with a water bath. Simply fill a
          large tub, or your sink, with cold water and stand the jars in it. If
          you’ve heated the milk in a dish that can withstand the switch from
          hot to cold without cracking, like a dutch oven, you can use ice
          water. Monitor the milk with the thermometer.
        </p>
        <h3>Add the starter</h3>
        <p>
          When the milk cools down to 115 F, it’s time to add the yogurt
          starter. This introduces the initial batch of live cultures that will
          bloom and grow in the milk. There are powdered yogurt starters, but
          it’s easy, and less expensive, to simply add spoonfuls of a previous
          batch of homemade or store-bought yogurt. Stir in a big spoonful of
          yogurt to each jar until fully incorporated into the milk.
        </p>
        <h3>Incubate</h3>
        <p>See above for how to incubate yogurt at home.</p>
        <h3>Cool yogurt</h3>
        <p>
          After eight to ten hours, remove the yogurt when it has reached the
          desired consistency: the longer it incubates the thicker the yogurt.
          Whey, the water byproduct of milk fermentation, will accumulate on
          top. Either whisk the liquid back into the yogurt or gently strain the
          yogurt through a cheesecloth or colander to get rid of the liquid if
          you want a thicker, Greek-style yogurt.
        </p>
        <h3>Refrigerate</h3>
        <p>
          Place the jars with the finished yogurt into the refrigerator. They
          will last for up to two weeks. Make sure to save some yogurt as a
          starter culture for your next batch. Add flavorings before you
          refrigerate or when you pull the yogurt out to enjoy.
