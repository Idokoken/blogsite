        <h2>Brirf Histoty of Nigeria</h2>
        <p>
          According to encyclopedia, the history of Nigeria can be traced to
          settlers trading across the middle East and Africa as early as 1100
          BC. Numerous ancient African civilizations settled in the region that
          is known today as Nigeria, such as the Kingdom of Nri, the Benin
          Empire, and the Oyo Empire. Islam reached Nigeria through the Bornu
          Empire between (1068 AD) and Hausa States around (1385 AD) during the
          11th century, while Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century
          through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from Portugal.The Songhai
          Empire also occupied part of the region. From the 15th century,
          European slave traders arrived in the region to purchase enslaved
          Africans as part of the Atlantic slave trade, which started in the
          region of modern-day Nigeria; the first Nigerian port used by European
          slave traders was Badagry, a coastal harbour.Local merchants provided
          them with slaves, escalating conflicts among the ethnic groups in the
          region and disrupting older trade patterns through the Trans-Saharan
          route.Lagos was occupied by British forces in 1851 and formally
          annexed by Britain in the year 1865.Nigeria became a British
          protectorate in 1901. The period of British rule lasted until 1960,
          when an independence movement led to the country being granted
          independence.Nigeria first became a republic in 1963, but succumbed to
          military rule three years later, after a bloody coup d'Ã©tat. A
          separatist movement later formed the Republic of Biafra in 1967,
          leading to the three-year Nigerian Civil War.Nigeria became a republic
          again after a new constitution was written in 1979.

          furthermore, according to the Nigerian Embassy, Nigeria, her people
          and culture, economy and politics, that sheds light on the tremendous
          potential of this African Giant. However, little is known to the
          outside world about the many exciting tourist attractions available in
          Nigeria: Historic sites nestled amid rivers and rain forests,
          breathtaking mountain vistas, remote creek villages, miles of pristine
          beaches and exotic national wildlife reserves. There are also museums,
          festivals, music and dance, a rich cultural melange right down to
          everyday traditional markets. These are just some of the spectacular
          sights and sensual delights awaiting the traveler to Nigeria. Nigeria
          has the largest population of any country in Africa (about 120
          million), and the greatest diversity of cultures, ways of life, cities
          and terrain. With a total land area of 923,768 sq. km. (356,668 sq.
          mi. Nigeria is the 14th largest country in Africa. Its coastline, on
          the Gulf of Guinea, stretches 774 km (480 mi.). Nigeria shares its
          international border of 4,470 km (2513 mi.) with four neighbors: Chad,
          Cameroon, Benin, and Niger. Until 1989 the capital was Lagos, with a
          population of about 2,500,000, but the government recently moved the
          capital to Abuja

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Virtually all the native races of Africa are represented in Nigeria,
          hence the great diversity of her people and culture. It was in Nigeria
          that the Bantu and SemiBantu, migrating from southern and central
          Africa, intermingled with the Sudanese. Later, other groups such as
          Shuwa-Arabs, the Tuaregs, and the Fulanis, who are concentrated in the
          far north, entered northern Nigeria in migratory waves across the
          Sahara Desert. The earliest occupants of Nigeria settled in the forest
          belt and in the Niger Delta region.Today there are estimated to be
          more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria. While no single group enjoys
          an absolute numeric majority, four major groups constitute 60% of the
          population: Hausa-Fulani in the north, Yoruba in the west, and Igbo in
          the east. Other groups include: Kanuri, Binis, Ibibio, Ijaw, Itsekiri,
          Efik, Nupe, Tiv, and Jukun.
